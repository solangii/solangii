I am an undergraduate who is interested in **deep learning**. Among deep learning, I am interested in **learning for generalization** and studying to solve the **limitations of deep learning** like **meta-learning** and **Lifelong-learning**. Currently, I'm working with [MIIL Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/swyoon89/research-interests) (Prof. Sung Whan Yoon) in UNIST as undergrad researcher.

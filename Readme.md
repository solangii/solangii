### Hi there :raised_hands:

I am Sorang Kim who is interested in DL/ML. Among them, I am especially interested in topics related to **generalization for learning** solving **limitations of deep learning**, such as **meta-learning**, **few-shot learning** and **lifelong learning**. Currently, I am a undergraduate at UNIST (major in CSE, minor in IE) and I am studying and researching above topics in the [MIIL Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/swyoon89/research-interests).
